# Reporting Security Issues in AutoBackend

As the sole developer of AutoBackend, I take security vulnerabilities very seriously. I am committed to maintaining the security of the project and appreciate any responsible disclosure of potential security risks.

If you have discovered a security issue within AutoBackend, I encourage you to disclose it to me confidentially. Please reach out directly to me via email autobackend@vorobalek.dev.

Upon receiving your report, I will respond promptly to confirm receipt and outline the next steps. I will keep you informed throughout the process of resolving the security issue, from investigation to deployment of a fix. Your contributions to improving AutoBackend's security will be fully acknowledged, and I am open to any collaboration necessary to address the risk.

For third-party modules with security issues, please report directly to the maintainers of those modules.

## AutoBackend Security Notification Process

At AutoBackend, the security notification process is straightforward due to the small scale of the project. I will personally handle all communications regarding security issues and ensure that they are addressed promptly and effectively.

## Enhancing Your Knowledge on Security

To further your understanding of security best practices, I am open to providing additional resources and articles on security. I am also ready to offer assistance and collaborate on mitigating any security risks associated with AutoBackend.
